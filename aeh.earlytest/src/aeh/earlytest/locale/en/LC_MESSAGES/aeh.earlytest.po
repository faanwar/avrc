msgid "about_the_early_test_1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: After becoming HIV infected, it typically takes up to 3 months to
#. develop a positive antibody test result. In rare cases, it may take even
#. longer.
#. During this "window period" when the HIV antibody test is negative, a
#. different
#. type of test - a type of 'viral load' test - can detect the presence of HIV.
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:27
msgid "about_the_early_test_2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: This type of test is not typically offered at HIV testing sites and

#. Default: If you test negative for the standard HIV antibody test, you will

#. antibody test?
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:90
msgid "what_is_the_diff_tests"
msgstr ""

#. Default: A standard HIV test detects antibodies that the person's immune
#. system
#. makes to fight HIV after infection and it could take up to six weeks or more
#. for
#. antibodies to develop. On the other hand, The Early Test detects the HIV
#. virus,
#. not the antibodies. The Early Test can detect HIV infection as early as one
#. week
#. after exposure.
#. Default: Although the use of Early Test methods are used to screen the blood
#. supply it is not standard of care for routine HIV testing. The Early Test is
#. being provided as a part of a research study that wants to learn about
#. finding
#. individuals that are in the earliest stages of HIV infection. To be part of
#. this
#. study you need to be 18 or older and give informed consent.

#. other factors that are related to your risk of HIV. Your personal
#. information
#. such as name and phone numbers will be collected so that we can contact you
#. with
#. test results if needed. You will have 3-4 tablespoons of blood taken. A
#. standard
#. HIV test will be taken, usually it will be possible to do this from oral
#. fluid.
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:120
msgid "what_is_involved_1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: If the standard HIV test is negative your blood will be sent for
#. the
#. Early Test. If the standard HIV test is preliminary positive, your blood
#. will be
#. sent for further tests which are necessary to confirm whether you have HIV.
#. Some
#. of the blood will also be tested to determine if your HIV infection is very
#. recent. Some of the blood will be stored so that it is available for
#. additional
#. tests if needed. If blood is left over it may be used for research on your
#. genes
#. that predict response to HIV and it’s treatment.

msgstr ""

#. Default: How long will it take to get my Early Test results?

msgid "how_long"
msgstr ""

#. Default: You will take a rapid antibody test first and get those results
#. during
#. your Early Test visit. If you test negative on the rapid test, we will draw
#. blood to send to the lab that performs the Early Test. If your Early Test
#. result
#. is negative, then you will be able to access your negative result through a
#. secure website or on a toll-free phone line two weeks after you have taken
#. the
#. test. If your Early Test result is positive, UCSD study personnel will

msgid "what_if_infected_1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Is there any other way that I might know that I got infected with
#. HIV
#. other than taking a test?
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:176
msgid "other_way_to_know"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Taking a test is the only conclusive way to determine if you are
#. infected. Many people have symptoms of fever, headache, rash, diarrhea, or
#. other
#. flu-like symptoms one to two weeks after being exposed to HIV. However, the
#. symptoms are so similar to a flu that most people do not recognize that they
#. have been infected by HIV.

msgstr ""

#. Default: Why do I need to know my HIV status right away?
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:195
msgid "why_know_now"
msgstr ""

#. Default: You are extremely infectious during the first few months after
#. contracting the virus. It is very important that you know your status as
#. soon as
#. possible after being infected so that you can protect others from being
#. infected. Also, many studies have proven that the earlier HIV is diagnosed,
#. the
#. better your long-term prognosis and quality of life.
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:202
msgid "why_know_now_1"

#. Default: Do I have to participate in the Early Test? What are the
#. alternatives?
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:214
msgid "must_participate"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Participation is voluntary. You do not have to participate in this
#. study. Alternatives include getting a routine HIV antibody test alone.
#. Testing
#. for HIV virus as a way to diagnose HIV is not routine, but it may be
#. available
#. outside of this study and you could look for availability elsewhere. Not
#. participating will have no effect on your care at UCSD.

#. the final results can also cause anxiety for some.
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:244
msgid "any_risk_3"
msgstr ""

#. Default: There is no way to prove that the virus you have is the same as
#. someone

#. infected
#. you. Counselors are available to talk about this.
#: src/aeh/earlytest/templates/pages/home.pt:245

msgid "any_risk_6"

#. Default: Is the Early Test confidential?
#. Default: The Early Test is confidential, but it is not anonymous. This means
